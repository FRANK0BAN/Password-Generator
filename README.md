## What is this project? 🤔

Hi, I’d like to introduce you to Password Generator, a simple Python project using the customtkinter library. It allows you to generate passwords, save them in .txt format, and choose between Dark and Light modes. Additionally, you can check if a password has been compromised in data breaches, and enjoy various interactive features for improved usability.


## Features 1.2 🔥 ✨

- Added a panel on the right side for adjusting text size, clearing the console, and organizing buttons and checkboxes.
- A new feature has been introduced that checks if a password has been compromised in any known data breaches or hacking incidents. This helps you determine whether a password is safe to use or not.
- The Light Mode has been redesigned to be more visually appealing and user-friendly, providing a better overall experience.
- Fixed bugs and enhanced performance.
- The application's color scheme has been refined to enhance visual aesthetics and provide a more pleasing appearance.

## About the repository

Nice to see you here! 

This is a public repository where I encourage you to comment on my project. I'm not going to lie, this is my first serious project that I have completed for the time being. I am a beginner programmer so please be understanding about the code :) - For example, not using grid placement.
